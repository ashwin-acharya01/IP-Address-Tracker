## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- LeafletJS for Maps
- IP Geolocation API for tracking IP addresses


### What I learned

Used LeafletJS for the first time and it was a lot of fun. Still have to learn a lot.


### Continued development



### Useful resources

- [LeafletJS documentation](https://leafletjs.com/) - Didn't know a single thing about LeafletJS. This documentation was a life saver.
